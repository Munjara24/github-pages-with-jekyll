# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about mental health.

What is meantal health? 

Too many people don't know the answer to this, it's the question we don't ask ourselves because we don't think it can affect us.
Well the sad true is, it can. So let me answer to the question "what is mental health?".

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. 
Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

But why mental health problems are so common? And can you and how you can prevent it?
